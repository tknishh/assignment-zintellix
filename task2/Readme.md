# Task 2 - Web Scraping Test

- **Instructions**: Write a Python script using the BeautifulSoup library to scrape information from a sample website. The goal is to extract a list of products along with their prices and ratings. You should then organize and print this information in a structured manner.

- **Problems**: The provided url of amazon wasn't working, and it returned a 503 error. I used a different url of flipkart to complete the task.

# Files

- `code.py` (contains the python script to scrape the website and print the information)
- `scrape.ipynb` (used this notebook to test and confirm the code results. You may find details of **Irrgulaties** with the url in this notebook.)
- `Can't retrieve site.png` (screenshot of the error when trying to access the amazon url)
- `Readme.md` (contains the details of the task and the files in the directory)
